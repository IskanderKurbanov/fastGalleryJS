Here, Enterprise is offloaded at Redstone Arsenal Airfield before being moved to Marshall’s Dynamic Test Stand. Today, Marshall is playing a vital role in the Artemis program by developing the Space Launch System, the backbone of NASA’s exploration plans and the only rocket capable of sending humans to the Moon and Mars.
